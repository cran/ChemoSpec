\usage{
plotSpectra(spectra, which = c(1), yrange = range(spectra$data),
  offset = 0, amplify = 1, lab.pos = mean(spectra$freq),
  showGrid = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{spectra}{An object of S3 class \code{\link{Spectra}}.}

\item{which}{An integer vector specifying which spectra to plot, and the
order.}

\item{yrange}{A vector giving the limits of the y axis desired, for instance
\code{c(0, 15)}.  This parameter depends upon the range of values in the
stored spectra and defaults to the height of the largest peak in the data
set.  Interacts with the next two arguments, as well as the number of
spectra to be plotted as given in \code{which}.  Trial and error is used to
adjust all these arguments to produce the desired plot.}

\item{offset}{A number specifying the vertical offset between spectra if
more than one is plotted.  Set to 0.0 for a stacked plot.}

\item{amplify}{A number specifying an amplification factor to be applied to
all spectra.  Useful for magnifying spectra so small features show up
(though large peaks will then be clipped, unless you zoom on the x axis).}

\item{lab.pos}{A number giving the location for the identifying label.
Generally, pick an area that is clear in all spectra plotted.  If no label
is desired, give \code{lab.pos} outside the plotted x range.}

\item{showGrid}{Logical.  Places light gray vertical lines at each tick mark
if \code{TRUE}.}

\item{\dots}{Additional parameters to be passed to plotting functions.}
}
\value{
None.  Side effect is a plot.

\description{
Plots the spectra stored in a \code{\link{Spectra}} object.  One may choose
which spectra to plot, and the x range to plot.  Spectra may be plotted
offset or stacked.  The vertical scale is controlled by a combination of
several parameters.
}
\examples{

data(metMUD1)
plotSpectra(metMUD1, main = "metMUD1 NMR Data",
	 which = c(10, 11), yrange = c(0,1.5),
	 offset = 0.06, amplify = 10, lab.pos = 0.5)

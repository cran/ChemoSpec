##### Version 1.48-1
Date: 10 October 2011
News:

NOTE: With these changes, some old code may break! Just a littleÉ

>> Thanks to Roberto Canteri (RC) of Fondazione Bruno Kessler for bringing some small bugs to my attention, and making some very useful suggestions.  Details below.
>> Added a method argument to normSpectra to pave the way for further options.
>> Converted sPlotSpectra to use base graphics (instead of ggplot2) so that  existing functions could be used to label points extreme points.  Thus an argument "tol" was added. 
>> Fixed a few help file issues.
>> Fixed a bug in plotHCA (a mis-placed parenthesis; noted by RC)
>> Added a function rowDist, written and suggested by RC, to give more options for distance calculations when doing HCA.  Changed functions hcaScores and hcaSpectra to use this new function, which required that the old argument method be renamed c.method and a new argument called d.method be added.  The full range of distance methods and clustering methods can now be employed.
>> Changed some aspects of plotScores to handle the cases where the number of members of the group was 3 or less differently (suggested by RC).  I don't think there are any changes to what the user sees, except possibly some warnings may have improved.
>> Changed groupNcolor so that it does not need to re-read the files in the directory to assign the groups.  This may make it easier to semi-manually build a Spectra object.
>> Changed groupNcolor to issue a warning if no match was found for a gr.crit value among the file names, or vice versa.
>> Fixed a bug in check4Gaps wherein the FALSE answer, i.e. no gaps, was only set properly if silent = FALSE.  Oddly, this caused the wrong answer in the help file example but had not been detected until now!
>> Changed the binData code, as suggested by RC, to chop off points differently.  Previously, there had been a limit of removing 50 points.  Now there is no limit, and the number of points removed is reported to the console.  Tested pretty thoroughly.
>> Made a small change to sumGroups (grep -> which) at the recommendation of RC.

##### Version 1.47-1
Date:  2011-07-28
News:
>> Fixed a few things needed to pass CRAN checks.

##### Version 1.47-0
Date:  2011-07-26
News:
>> Fixed a problem with splitSpectraGroups which caused an error when only one instruction was passed to the function.
>> Also modified splitSpectraGroups to allow a new set of colors to be assigned based upon the splitting instructions (when only one splitting instruction is given).  This is a different way of changing colors than conColScheme.
>> Changed plotScores so that the key to the type of ellipses drawn and the description of the type of PCA conducted are both in the upper lefthand corner of the plot.  This avoids having the two pieces of text overlap which occurred when physically small plots were created.
>> Added a centering argument to classPCA.  This is for compatibility with the aovPCA series of functions which need to carry out PCA but have already centered the data matrix.  The default is still to center so no earlier code should break and users really don't need to do anything different.
>> Added functions aovPCA, avgFacLvls, aovPCAscores and aovPCAloadings, written by Matt Keinsley.  These functions carry out ANOVA-PCA as described by Harrington.  See the help pages.
>> Added function sPlotSpectra which implements an s-plot which is a useful adjunct to loadings plots (written by Matt Keinsley).
>> Data set gasNIR was removed.

##### Version 1.46-4
Date:  2011-03-26
News:
>> Fixed a few MORE problems giving CRAN trouble!

##### Version 1.46-3
Date:  2011-3-24
News:
>> Fixed a few little problems giving CRAN trouble

##### Version 1.46-2
Date:  2011-3-24
News:
>> Improved the help file for getManyCsv.
>> Something is up with the orthogonal distance plot or calculation.  Need to fix.
>> Fixed a few little problems giving CRAN trouble

##### Version 1.46-1
Date:  2010-12-21
News:
>> Fixed a typo which caused an error in an example.

##### Version 1.46
Date:  2010-8-27
News:
>> Modified classPCA and robPCA so that they no longer normalized samples by rows.  Now users must normalize manually if desired, using normSpectra.
>> Added a function splitSpectra groups which allows one to use the existing spectra$groups entries to create new groups, stored in new elements of the Spectra object.
>> Added a function hypTestScores which facilitates carrying out hypothesis tests on PCA results.
>> Added function hmapSpectra which creates a seriated heat map of samples and spectral data.
>> WARNING: Several of the vignette examples seem to be behaving strangely.  May be a problem with CuticleIR, the code seems OK.
>> 51 Functions total.

##### Version 1.45
Date:  2010-8-04
News:
>> No changes; version 1.44 didn't seem to build correctly.

##### Version 1.44
Date:  2010-7-13
News:
>> When using robPCA with choice "mad" a warning is issued which comes from the latest version of package pcaPP.  It only concerns performance (speed) and may be ignored.
>> ggobi is on "life support" and hence development of plotScoresG is on hold until ggobi comes back to life or is replaced.  Related to this, some of the color schemes presented in the vignette and discussed in relationship to ggobi appear to have been changed.
>> Added warnings to specSurvey if there are 1-3 group members, as this makes interpreation of the descriptive statistics tricky.  If there are 3 or fewer group members, the survey results for this group are dropped from the display and a warning is issued.
>> Made significant changes to removeFreq. There was a problem with how NMR data were handled; this led to a significant re-write.  Everything seems to test out now.
>> Added two data sets: SrE.IR and SrE.NMR, see the documentation.
>> Fixed a problem with the subtitle in plotLoadings.
>> Fixed a few typos of course.
>> Still 48 functions.

##### Version 1.43
Date:  2009-12-27
News:
>> A revised version of specSurvey was implemented which permits one to use not only sd, but also sem, iqr and mad to examine the data sets.  In addition, one can look at each group of spectra separately, or analyze the entire data set.
>> Fixed a axis labeling error in plotScoresRGL & plotScores3D
>> Fixed an error in getManyCsv in which the entire data matrix in the final Spectra object originated from the first spectrum.  This had been introduced when format = "csv2" was added in 1.42.
>> 48 functions total

##### Version: 1.42
Date: 2009-12-21
News:
>> Added optional outlier labeling to plotScoresRGL.
>> Added robust or classical confidence ellipses as an option to plotScoresRGL and plotScores3D.
>> Further development of plotScoresG is on hold until rggobi is rebuilt for R 2.10.  When it returns, will add use.sym and confidence ellipses to it.
>> Added mclustSpectra, a wrapper to mclust methods.
>> Added mclust3D, a function which permits 3D display of groups identified by mclust.  Either robust or classical confidence ellipses are displayed.  mclust3dSpectra is the front end in the package.
>> Several support functions added (labelExtremes3d, normVec, makeEllipsoid).
>> Added a format option "csv2" to getManyCsv for folks in the EU.  Thanks to Richard Pena bringing this to my attention.
>> Updated all help files.
>> Expanded vignette.
>> 43 Functions total

##### Version: 1.41
Date: 2009-12-09
News:
>> Completed implementation of the use.sym argument to plotting routines which require it.
>> 36 Functions total.

##### Version: 1.40
Date: 2009-12-09
News:
>> Added the first version of the vignette, which lacks detailed references.
>> Added man page colorSymbol.Rd to collect all recommendations about color and its use in one place.
>> Added a function to convert color schemes of an existing Spectra object into a new color scheme (conColScheme).
>> Expanded the creation and use of Spectra objects to include plotting symbols and alternate plotting symbols for each group, randomly assigned.  These are needed for b/w plots and also for viewing by color-blind individuals.  The relevant functions now have argument use.sym = FALSE which controls this feature.
>> Fixed an error in how colors and groups were matched up - it was being done differently in different functions.  Function sumGroups now handles this task for consistency.
>> Updated the help files.
>> The GitHub site now gets a .tar.gz source file for Mac users, and a .zip file for Windows users.
>> Also included is a file with installation instructions.

##### Version: 1.31
Date: 2009-11-30
News:
Added function plotScoresRGL which does interactive 3D plots of scores using the rgl package.  This is an alternative to plotScoresG which uses ggobi and rggobi.  Necessitates new dependency on rgl.
Added data set gasNIR.

##### Version: 1.30
Date: 2009-11-25
News:
Fixed certain .Rd files so the reference manual prints correctly.
Fixed a problem in plotSpectra having to do with the placement of the label if the frequency range was descending.
Removed default xrange in plotSpectra so that users can specify their own xlim via the ... concept.
Added function binData and split trimNbin into removeFreq and binBuck;  in turn, this required adding a check4Gaps function.
Changed sumSpectra to report the number of frequency points, report any gaps in the data, and report the frequency unit/data point correctly.  Also set it up so that users can pass ... arguments.
Added a function to normalize Spectra objects by the sum of each data row (other normalization schemes can be added later).
Added a helper function isWholeNo.
Revised the Spectra object description standard so that unit is only two characters long (NMR = logical was eliminated as it was not used anywhere).
Added and uppdated Rd files.

##### Version: 1.2
Date: 2009-10-14
News:
Added plotScoresG to create ggobi visualizations of the pca results.
Made color schemes consistent with ggobi color schemes.
Clarified and expanded selected documentation files.

##### Version: 1.1
Date: 2009-09-23
News:
Modified colLeaf so that the leaf label size would vary with the number of leaves to be plotted.
Added ... to plot arguments in HCA so that user can pass additional plotting parameters.
Added function plotSpectra which was overlooked in the first build!
Added a description of Spectra objects to the man pages.
Added function plotScores3D to produce simple 3D plots.
Added plotScoresG to create ggobi visualizations of the pca results.
Made color schemes consistent with ggobi color schemes.
Clarified and expanded selected documentation files.

NOTE:  This development version of ChemoSpec requires mclust 4.0 which is not widely available.  It is expected on CRAN by the end of July.

How to install ChemoSpec
=======================

To install from Github using R:
------------------------------
install.packages("devtools")

library("devtools")

install_github(repo = "ChemoSpec", username = "bryanhanson", branch = "master")

library("ChemoSpec")

If you use branch = "devel" you can get the development branch if it is available.  My habit is to keep these operational but not necessarily complete.  Devel versions would be ahead of what's on CRAN.

From CRAN using R:
------------------

chooseCRANmirror() # select a CRAN mirror

install.packages("ChemoSpec")

library("ChemoSpec")

To get to the Vignette:
-----------------------

vignette("ChemoSpec")
